camaro benchmarks
=================

A repo to keep track of performance regression of camaro. Extracted from camaro repo.

I don't want to polute camaro's dependencies (even development dependencies) hence a separate repo.

```sh
camaro v4 x 351 ops/sec ±0.28% (88 runs sampled)
camaro v3 x 1,145 ops/sec ±0.35% (96 runs sampled)
rapidx2j x 232 ops/sec ±0.50% (91 runs sampled)
xml2json x 46.09 ops/sec ±1.49% (61 runs sampled)
xml2js x 51.41 ops/sec ±7.24% (69 runs sampled)
fast-xml-parser x 217 ops/sec ±2.99% (80 runs sampled)
xml-js x 47.13 ops/sec ±6.48% (64 runs sampled)
```
